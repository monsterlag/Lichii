# Packaged AV1 smoke test

Configure Lichii with `-DLICHII_AV1_SMOKE_TEST=ON`, then build the
`av1_decode_smoke` target. This does not require `YUZU_TESTS` or Catch2.
It links the same selected FFmpeg libraries as `video_core`, looks up AV1 by
codec ID, and decodes an original synthetic frame on the CPU. A missing decoder,
decode error, missing frame, or incorrect visible pixels returns a nonzero exit code.

Run `av1_decode_smoke.exe` beside the packaged Windows binaries after their DLLs
have been collected. Use a fresh process with `PATH` restricted to Windows system
directories so the build environment cannot supply missing DLLs. Run from the package
directory, outside the dependency installation. A missing imported DLL fails at process
startup, before the test can print its diagnostic. The probe can be removed before
publishing the package.

This checks the libraries selected for that build and their packaged runtime dependencies.
It does not inspect FFmpeg already statically linked into an existing emulator executable,
test GPU decoding, or fix an AV1-less package. The private Windows player integration
workflow enables this target and selects MSYS2 UCRT64 FFmpeg with bundled FFmpeg disabled.
Other builds remain opt-in; the upstream release workflow is unchanged.

## Windows player integration CI

The manual-only `.github/workflows/minimal-windows-av1-smoke.yml` delegates to
`build88-windows-mingw-pgo.yml`, which builds the GUI, CLI, regression tests, and probe.
It collects recursive DLL dependencies and runs the packaged CLI loader and AV1 checks
with `PATH` restricted to Windows system directories. The probe executable is removed
before the complete player package and its result report are uploaded for seven days.

`workflow_dispatch` does not run automatically. GitHub requires the workflow to exist on
the repository's default branch before it can be manually dispatched. Select a ref that
contains this probe and workflow. This checks the private player package, not an existing
official release or a different dependency selection.

## Fixture provenance

The embedded 22-byte OBU stream contains one lossless 16x16 black YUV420P frame
(Y=16, U=V=128). It contains no game data. It was generated using FFmpeg's
`color` source and libaom 3.15.0 with this command:

```sh
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=black:s=16x16:r=1 -frames:v 1 -c:v libaom-av1 \
  -cpu-used 8 -threads 1 -crf 0 -b:v 0 -still-picture 1 -lag-in-frames 0 \
  -f obu black16.obu
```

Encoder versions may produce different valid bytes. The test checks the decoded
pixels, dimensions, format, and frame count, rather than the encoder's byte stream.
